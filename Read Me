This script was written for a specific domain and has the domain specific data removed. It may need tweaking to get working.
The idea is that you point the script to your SMTP Relay and to your domain controller IP Address or name and the script will run through each
Windows based machine in the "Servers" OU and compare the time against the DC, as well as verify if the Server is using the DC as it's upstream
NTP server. Useful for time sensitive environments.
